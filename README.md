This is a function that interpolates a variable in a series of "steps"
That is, we've got a minimum and a maximum of a variable
and we want to distribute its variation in a series of steps
The function (steps) returns a list with 12 elements, each giving a level
of the variable from the min to the max with intermediate levels that
vary as closely to linear as possible
It's implemented in python and the docstring and comments give more details
about the algorithm and what it is based on
A translation into matlab is also included in the rep
